//! This example demonstrates picking of file path.
//!
//! Note that picking a file path does not work on wasm, if you want cross
//! platform solution including wasm, you need to pick+load at once which is
//! provided with `load_file` instead of `pick_file_path`. See the example
//! `load.rs` for that.
